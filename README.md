# speedrun-app

This app currently only exists of a backend written in typescript using express.js. I used it to try out express and more importantly Github Copilot.  
It uses TypeORM for the data. To use it look at the [README](https://github.com/LucaSchwan/speedrun-app/tree/main/speedrun-api#readme) in the speedrun_api folder.
